# Dream Place
It's a small game for Unreal Engine 4 class's homework. Hopefully, it will grows up to an excellent mobile game.

#### Week 1

I only used UE4 Third Person template to create my initial game. In next steps, I will add more features and functions to make my little game more interesting.

#### Week 2

This week ,the plan was adding the target and bullet, as well as score system. However, up to now, I'm stuck in adding score system. I cannot find the way delivering data from Bullet's OnHit function to Character AddScore function. Also, this time the game is played in the PC, not Android.



##### Shoot Animation

I used Animation Blueprint to add the shoot animation which was driven by key "J".

##### Socket the weapon

I added a socket to the right hand, and new a skeletal mesh (Pistol) to this socket. Unfortunately, the pistol didn't attach to the right place. Therefore, I manually modified its relative position.

##### Add the bullet and target

I use sphere as the bullet and make it projectile. Target is a plastic container.
